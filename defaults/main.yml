# Role defaults

# Some tasks need admin permissions. This will be done with "become" parameter of Ansible.
# The default method is "sudo". So, ensure your username has sudo permissions to install
# packages and change system files, such as repository files.
vscode_tasks:
  - { enabled: true, name: 'configure_vscode' }  # Requires -K option

# This is just an example. More information in vars/configure_vscode.yml
vscode_workspaces:
  - { enabled: false, state: 'directory', action: 'add', name: 'OpenSCAP',
      path: "{{ ansible_facts['user_dir'] }}/OpenSCAP" }
